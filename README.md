# Alx-Higher level programming - Python, Databases & JavaScript

This repository contains programs written for the higher-level programming
track at Holberton School. In these projects, which began occurring in month
four of the curriculum, I'm learning Python, MySQL and JavaScript.
Simultaneously, I continued to reinforce and expand my skills in C and shell
scripting. The specific list of projects contained follows:

* [0x00-Python - Hello, World](./0x00-python-hello_world)

* [0x01-Python-if_else_loops_functions](./0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions)
